# <Design doc title>

## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed design

> This is the bulk of the design document.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar to the design to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics, mechanics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature/change/addition/etc is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here. 

### Role

> What is the expected role of the feature/change/addition/etc 
within its category (e.g. weapon, perk, class, etc) and in overall picture?

### Stats

> Stat tables TODO

### Ingame depiction

> Namings, descriptions, icons, customizer stats, etc.

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this?

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs/mechanics/stats/etc have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> This section could also include prior art, that is, how other sources in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
