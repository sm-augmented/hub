# <RFC title>

## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed design

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar to the design to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this?

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> This section could also include prior art, that is, how other sources in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
